### A little about me

I have worked with Python, Javascript and Django for 10 years, and lead Agile delivery teams working with these technologies since 2014.
I have a passion for open source and creating web applications.

I love taking photos, riding my bike to work, making (and drinking) cocktails and coffee. I don't tweet much, but I do post brief updates on my own [microblog called Briefly][briefly].

I have a passion for teaching people to code: I've helped run free training courses (MelbDjango School), volunteered at DjangoGirls events (in Melbourne and Washington D.C.) and taught Python/Django in corporate environments.
